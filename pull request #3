* It follows immediately from the contract for <tt>compare</tt> that the
 * quotient is an <i>equivalence relation</i> on <tt>S</tt>, and that the
 * imposed ordering is a <i>total order</i> on <tt>S</tt>.  When we say that
 * the ordering imposed by <tt>c</tt> on <tt>S</tt> is <i>consistent with
 * equals</i>, we mean that the quotient for the ordering is the equivalence
 * relation defined by the objects' {@link Object#equals(Object)
 * equals(Object)} method(s):<pre>
 *     {(x, y) such that x.equals(y)}. </pre>
 *
 * <p>Unlike {@code Comparable}, a comparator may optionally permit
 * comparison of null arguments, while maintaining the requirements for
 * an equivalence relation.
